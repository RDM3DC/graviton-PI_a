Gravity isn’t a separate force added to QM. It’s an adaptive rule that regulates how much quantum entanglement can flow through spacetime. Spacetime geometry emerges from this regulation.

Two-part state of the universe

We model the universe as a pair (Ψ, Π) on a graph G = (V, E):

Quantum matter state:
|Ψ(t)⟩ ∈ H = ⊗_{v∈V} C^2
(qubits / quantum degrees of freedom on nodes)

Classical geometry field:
Π(t) = { π_uv(t) | (u,v) ∈ E }
(adaptive “curvature / connection strength” on edges)

So reality is quantum matter living on an adaptive graph.

Gravitons = adaptive quantum logic gates

Instead of treating gravitons as particles, we treat them as local entangling operations whose strength is set by geometry.

Dynamic Hamiltonian:
H(t) = Σ_{(u,v)∈E} J(π_uv(t)) * Ô_uv

Where:
Ô_uv is a 2-body quantum operator (XX / Heisenberg / XXZ).
J(π) ∝ π, so curvature directly controls interaction speed.

Time-step gate:
U(t) = exp( −i * δt * H(t) )

So geometry literally decides which quantum gates fire and how strongly.

Entanglement backreacts on geometry (ARP-Einstein rule)

Geometry updates using an ARP-style reward/penalty law based on local entanglement load.

Bond / link entropy:
S_uv(t) = −Tr( ρ_uv ln ρ_uv )

Backreaction:
π̇_uv = −η ( S_uv − S_target ) − μ ( π_uv − π_0 )

Interpretation:
If entanglement is too high → spacetime dilates (π drops), choking flow.
If entanglement is too low → spacetime contracts (π rises), boosting coherence.
Leak term μ stabilizes geometry around a rest metric π_0.

This is the algorithmic analog of Einstein’s equation:
matter/entanglement tells space how to curve, space tells matter how to evolve.

Emergent distance = information distance (ER = EPR)

From the matter state, compute mutual information I(i:j).
Define emergent distance:

d(i,j) ∝ −log( I(i:j) + ε )

So geometry is not assumed — it’s read out from entanglement structure.
